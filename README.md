#UnityTD
UnityTD is my second attempt at a Unity Game. At this point it is incomplete, but has the basic features needed to be playable. There are a tonne more features I would like to add(procedural maps, terrain, more turrets and enemies, etc.), but it has been backburnered by other projects and work.

##Gameplay
There is no win condition, the player can't win. Enemies will continue to spawn until they have reached the end enough times, at which point the level will reload and begin again. There are 2 choices of turrets currently, a basic version and extended reach. Like any good TD, the the turrets cost money which is earned by killing enemies. I haven't quite balanced it out yet. Select a turret from the bottom toolbar, and then select a platform to build.

This game is based off the one found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beuoNuK2tbk) but with some changes made in anticipation of future features.
